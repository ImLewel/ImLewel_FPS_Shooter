# P.S.
* Project is in early alpha (or even pre alpha), however you can play it; 
* Plan list will shrink or grow during development;
* If you want to support my project or contribute/collaborate contact me using any way, described in my profile, you prefer best!
* You can also suggest any idea not mentioned in the list or describe your opinion at some point how you see it;
* Development takes a lot of time even to implement some small feature, because I have to consider about perfomance, further impacts on gaming process and also development process, make tests and debug. But I'm trying my best to improve game every commit I make ^_^
